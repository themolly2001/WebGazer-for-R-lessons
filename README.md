# 👀 WebGazer for R Lessons

A web-based application that uses **eye-tracking technology** to monitor student engagement during R programming lessons. This project leverages **WebGazer.js** and integrates with custom logic to collect, analyze, and visualize gaze data for educational insights.

---

## 📌 Overview

The goal of this project is to help instructors understand **how students interact with R programming content** by tracking their eye movements. This data can reveal learning bottlenecks and improve instructional design through **data-driven insights**.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Eye-Tracking Integration**: Uses [WebGazer.js](https://webgazer.cs.brown.edu/) for real-time gaze tracking.
- **Data Collection**: Captures gaze coordinates and session data for analysis.
- **Visualization**: Displays heatmaps and engagement metrics to identify areas of focus.
- **Customizable Lessons**: Supports embedding R code snippets and interactive exercises.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Eye Tracking**: WebGazer.js  
- **Backend (Optional)**: Node.js, MongoDB for storing gaze data  
- **Data Analysis**: R for statistical insights and visualization
